### Overview:
 We are given an input (x,y) size of maze with Xs, the G Goal and your coordinate S. And the output will be coordinates of the path that was taken to reach the
goal in an array. The movement is restricted to either increment or decrement by 1 along x or y axis. Like king will move in chess without the ability to move diagonally. You are not allowed to move to a coordinate marked with X. The goal is to reach the G(Goal) mentioned in the maze in most optimised way possible.
